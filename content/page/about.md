## Hi, I'm Jarrett

I am a Geospatial Software Engineer located in the Pacific NW.

I'm currently at [Element 84](https://element84.com).

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jkeifer/) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jarrettkeifer).

I enjoy designing and building systems to operate at scale, at layers closer to
bare metal than not. Except my desire to support remote sensing data processing and
earth science applications leaves me stuck in the cloud much of the time.

Back down on the ground, I enjoys traveling and getting outside to run, hike,
climb, ski (classic nordic), or just stare at the sky and think about how crazy
it is that weâ€™re in a little bubble floating through space.
