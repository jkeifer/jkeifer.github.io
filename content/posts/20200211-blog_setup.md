As I mentioned in my first post, much of my resistance to blogging has been a
blend of prefectionism and an abhorrence to any chance of having to deal with
yet more infrastructure issue. That is, I deal with broken crap at my day job;
I really don't want to have to worry about that for my blog. In that vein, I
pursued the simplest practical stack with the quickest startup time, ending up
with a static site generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) hosted as a GitHub
page.

I initially deliberated between making my own generator and choosing something
premade. The "quick startup time" combined with my desire to support both
markdown and org-mode input files meant a simple shell script of my own design
probably wasn't the best choice. I also did not want to use something requiring
node.js, nor did a ruby/python project feel like the most user-friendly path
forward.

Hugo, as a go program, is a single statically-linked binary, meaning less to
worry about about and a quicker start. I had also played with it in the past
and knew it was featureful enough that anything I might want to do in the
future it would support. In the spirit of just getting this done, the decision
was made, and I didn't look back.

Installing Hugo is easy on Mac, just `brew install hugo`. Done.

To actually create my blog, I started with the [quick-start
guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). However, I ended up
throwing it all away when I realized the default was not going to work well
with [GitHub
pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).
That is, GitHub pages, for a user or organization page, expects the master
branch of a repo to have the static site files in the root, namely the
index.html file. But we don't want to pollute our source branch with the build
files (more on that in a future post), so we need to have a separate branch
with the hugo source content. Therefore, it became clear that setting up the
repo _before_ creating the hugo project is key.

First we create a repo, make a source branch, and then we can create a hugo
project in the repo:

```sh
mkdir your-blog
cd your-blog
git init
git checkout -b src
hugo new site . --force
```

It is also good to add a `.gitignore` before we get much further:

```sh
cat > .gitignore <<EOF

# Hugo output directories
/public
/resources

## OS Files
# Windows
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
Desktop.ini
$RECYCLE.BIN/

# OSX
.DS_Store
EOF
```

We'll also need to create a repo on GitHub, obviously. For a user/orgnaization
GitHub pages site, the repo needs to be named like `your-username.github.io`,
and when we publish content it will be available at that URL.

Now that we have some files and a GitHub repo, let's commit and push this src
branch:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "inital commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-blog.git
git push -u origin src
```

We now have a Hugo project, but it still needs some setup. Following the
quickstart guide, we need to add a theme and some content. Then we can run the
local server to validate everything works. I chose to start with the [Bare
theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/bare-hugo-theme/):

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/orf/bare-hugo-theme.git themes/bare
git submodule update --init --recursive  # actually clone the submodule

hugo new content/posts/first_post.md

# edit your post and set draft to false

hugo server  # test the site, accessible at localhost:1313
```

Great, but how do we publish this? By default Hugo will output the built site
into `./public/`. Because of the aforementioned expectation of GitHub pages, we
need that directory to map to somehow map to our master branch. Enter git
worktrees.

Worktrees allow one to checkout multiple working copies of a repo into
different directories backed by the same local clone. Interestingly, they can
be nested, so we can make our `./public/` directory a worktree checkout of the
master branch:

```sh
git checkout --orphan master  # create the master branch with no parent commits
git commit --allow-empty -m "initial content branch"
git push origin master
git checkout src
git worktree add -B master public origin/master
```

Now a Hugo build will create files in the master branch via our ./public/
worktree.  We can commit and push everything, and our content should show up on
our Github pages site:

```sh
hugo  # build the site into ./public/
git add . && git commit -m "new content added"
(cd public && git add . && git commit -m "publish new site content")
git push --all
```

And there it is, a Hugo site hosted on GitHub pages.

I'll note that I did consult the [Hugo GitHub pages
documentation](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/),
but it does not provide any instructions for a user/org account on separate
branches in the same repo, as I desired.
