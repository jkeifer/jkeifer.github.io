As of late I've been on a bit of a writing streak. My coworker [Julia
Signell](https://github.com/jsignell) and I have written four posts for [our
company's blog](https://element84.com/blog) (which I have mirrored on this site
[here](zarr-cog), [here](chunking-part-1), [here](chunking-part-2), and
[here](raster-compression)), and I have another post awaiting imminent
publishing on [the Cloud Native Geospatial Forum's
blog](https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog). I also have a number of other ideas
queued up.

With all of this new content and these new ideas I began to get the itch to
resurrect this blog. I never intended for it to peter out as it did.  Despite
the same intentions now, I'm sure it it will peter out again, but I figure I
might as well seize the momentum I have going right now and get some updates
out before that inevitably happens again.

## The new look

To go with this new start I decided to give the site a new look. I was never
satisfied with the previous theme, I just picked something serviceable and
tried to focus on writing. I'm super picky about appearance, except I'm not
particularly good on the front end side of things, so I can spend _a lot_ of
time tweaking formatting and layouts trying to achieve perfection. But that's
generally a waste of time, and I often fail to get it the way I want.

Except nowadays with rise of LLM agentic coding I can actually make things the
way I want! A bit of Claude Code, some strong specification and guidance, a
fair bit of manual review and tweaking, and voila! I have the theme I always
wanted to make.

Well, mostly; I still wish it felt a touch more like plain html with some
modernity sprinkled on top, and some things are not quite up to the level of
polish I might hope for. I also realize the content of the site can use a
boost, like better fleshing out [the new about page](about.md) or making the
home page feel more like, well, home. But all in all it I think it is a great
theme with the features I need to do cool stuff.

I'm hoping to get a chance to write up some details about the theme development
process before it isn't relevant anymore. We'll see if that happens.

## The new domain

Along with the new look I got a new domain! Way back in the day I ran a blog at
a custom domain, and I considered bringing that domain along to this blog when
I started it up back in 2020. Except it's a long domain, and I don't feel like
it really reflects what I want this blog to be. So I didn't use a custom domain
at all, and just left this site at my default github pages URL.

This time around I decided I need to get the domain. I'd been ideating about a
domain name for years, and I never came up with anything good. But I finally
got there.

Introducing [teotl.dev]({{< ref "/" >}})!

Teotl is a Nahuatl word traditionally translated as "god" or something adjacent
to that meaning, but modern scholarship suggests that's an erroneous and overly
simplistic representation. I did not choose it to suggest I have any sense of
godlike writing abilities or to allude to some sort of holiness or perfection
present in my writings. Rather, the choice of teotl is to imply a sense of
knowledge bringing order from chaos.

## More to come

If nothing else I hope to have some more content mirrored here over the coming
months. I also have a lot of presentations coming up this fall, which I hope to
be able to document here.

So stay tuned, and let me know what you think of the new look and content.
